butter on both sides, cut in half for two meals.

# Dip
Rule #1, don't buy any kind of cheese thinking it will melt nicely.

## Velveta
Watch out on the serving size

1 oz velveta
1/3 lb ground beef
2 tablespoons salsa
1 teaspoon cumin

## Making your own chips
Low carb tortillas from Mission work nicely. If you cut the tortilla like a pizza, and oil both sides with salt, you can cook in the oven 350 degrees for ~17 minutes for some nice crispy chips that are only 4g of carbs.
