# Picky Eaters Guide to Dirty Keto

Hi, this repo doesn't contain any code, just plans for implementing the keto dietary system and my weight loss journey on Keto. I chose git/markdown/GitHub because I think this will evolve and change over time, and I want to track that. I also value using markdown to keep the documents simple, and I hope contributions are easier to manage.

**There's 2 things I think you will want to know right off the bat to make a quick determination. That being: what foods you can & can't eat and what rituals are involved to get the gains. I will get to both of those as quick as I can but here's some things we have to cover first.**

### Warnings

If you experience any of the following symptoms, call emergencies services immediately:
1. Extreme Fatigue
2. Confusion
3. Extreme thirst
4. Troubles breathing


Foods high in animal fats and oils can increase your risk of heart disease. Experts still aren't sure if a low or no carb diet is healthy. Talk to your healthcare provider before trying a low or no carb diet.

## General Info
The ketogenic (keto) diet is a very low-carb, medium protein, high-fat diet. When carbs are restricted, the body enters a metabolic state called ketosis, which begins burning fat as a primary fuel source in place of carbs. 

### Quick/Early Exit
Thought I'd put this here so you can nope out of this bothers you. I would not recommend keto if you aren't willing to do blood testing from finger pricks. Overall, there's a method to make it not painful and I have some advice if it is painful, because it's possible to sample with minimal bother. However, if you cannot do a finger prick you might want to reconsider.

Here's what you can and can't eat. Remember, keto is "low" carb, it's possible some of these foods can be consumed so long as you stay under your daily limit for carbs. For me, that is a maximum of 25 grams a day. Just remember that you have a budget and everything has a cost, as long as those match you'll lose weight. The better you are about reducing carbs, the more consistently you will lose weight.

#### What is a Carbohydrate? (aka what can I NOT eat)
Carbohydrates are a macronutrient that exist in fibers, starches, and sugars. They turn into glucose when processed by the body. These are "bad" because they prevent your body from entering ketosis and burning fat.

These are the things you **CANNOT** eat*:

>*There are some exceptions
- Grains
	- Rice
	- Oatmeal
	- Wheat
	- Pasta
	- Bread
	- Cereals
	- Crackers
- Fruits
	- Everything, except the berries mentioned in the next section
- Starchy Vegetables
	- Corn
	- Peas
	- Potatoes
- Beans & Legumes
	- Black beans
	- Chickpeas
	- Lentils
	- Lima Beans
	- Kidney beans
- Sugar, Snacks, & Juices
	- Agave nectar
	- Cane Syrup or Corn Syrup
	- Dextrose, fructose, or sucrose
	- Honey
	- Molasses
	- Brown & White Sugar
	



#### What CAN I eat?
When looking at the nutritional label for total carbs, know that **Dietary Fibers** aren't counted in keto. Anything that has carbs, but are only under dietary fiber or classified as a Sugar Alcohol, you can subtract from the total carbs to calculate the [Net Carbs](#calculating-net-carbs).


**NOTE**: You can have cacao and cocoa (aka dark chocolate), see the section on [chocolate](#Foods#Ingredients) for more information.

#### High Fat Protein Sources
- Beef
- Chicken thighs
- Salmon/Tuna/Shellfish
- Eggs
- Bacon (in moderation)
- Full-fat Greek yogurt
- Cottage cheese

#### Low carb vegetables
- Cabbage
- Broccoli
- Asparagus
- Brussels Sprouts
- Spinach
- Kale
- Green Beans
- Peppers
- Zucchini
- Cauliflower
- Celery

#### Fruits
Sadly, fruits have a TON of natural sugar. So if it's sweet, you can't have it.

Exceptions:
- Strawberries
- Blueberries
- Blackberries

#### Fat Sources
- Butter
- Ghee
- Avocados
- Coconut Oil/MCT oil
- Olive Oil
- Sesame Oil
- Walnut Oil

#### Cheeses
- (Sharp) Cheddar
- Cream Cheese
- Gouda
- Swiss
- Blue Cheese
- Manchego
- Munster



### Dirty vs. Clean Keto
As the title implies, this is a guide for dirty keto. You will need to use vitamins because when you remove nutrition, the food can simply become a number that needs to fit within a range. That is often easier to reason about and manage.

| Dirty Keto | Keto |
|-|-|
| Focuses on caloric intake, not nutrition. Vitamins & supplements are needed to prevent malnutrition. | Focuses on nutrient-dense foods emphasizing quality of nutrition while also achieving desired dietary numbers. |

Clean Keto also promotes not eating highly processed foods, regardless of the carb count; like avoiding nitrates in meats, as an example. Again, you can take this as far as you want, but intuitively know that the easier something is to store, prepare, and eat, the more likely it is to be processed.

> Call out for high sodium, sometimes you trade one problem for another. That's why it's crucial to scrutinize the WHOLE label (ingredients & nutritional facts) to be better informed.





### What are Ketones?
Ketones are a metabolic byproduct from the liver when burning fat for fuel instead of glucose. They are alternative fuels for the body that are made when a lack of glucose is available to the body.

### What is Ketosis?

*DISCLAIMER: I am not a medical professional, but will do my best to describe how this works in the body*

Your body prefers to use blood sugar (aka glucose) for energy. In the absence of glucose, the pancreas reduces insulin production though it continues producing glucagon and epinephrine at normal levels. This combination of low insulin, normal glucagon and epinephrine causes fat to release from the fat cells. Those freed fats then circulate through the blood, reach the liver, and break down into ketones (beta-hydroxybutyrate, also known as BHB). Those ketones then circulate back into the bloodstream and are picked up by the muscles and other tissues to fuel the body's metabolism.


### What is Ketoacidosis
Non-diabetic ketoacidosis occurs when the ketone levels are too high in the body. Ketoacidosis is deadly/life-threatening if left untreated. The buildup of ketones causes the blood pH to drop, causing drowsiness, stupor, coma, and death. The solution is to force the body to produce insulin, either naturally (if it is non-emergency) or by insulin injection.

>Note: Lactation & breastfeeding may pose a higher danger/risk; please seek advice from a medical professional if this is you.

### What to expect during the transition
You will not feel well during the transition from burning carbs to fat. This is because your body is not producing glucose or ketones at high enough levels. As a result, you will have symptoms described as the "keto flu". I've had the keto flu several times by having levels out of range. The good news, this is easily detectable in a blood test and is relatively easy to correct.

I would highly recommend buying exogenous ketone powder/pills to help you transition. As mentioned above, your body doesn't have a fuel source until your liver starts producing ketones in/around 1 mmol/L. When I am less than 1 mmol/L or higher than 2 mmol/L, I feel a little yucky. When I'm too low, I take exogenous ketone supplements to raise the ketone levels in the blood immediately. There are a few products I mention here, one doesn't increase it by much, and the pill form that I have increases by 1 mmol. The effects can be quick, and it's immediately available for consumption when it enters the bloodstream. When your ketone levels are too high, you need to eat carbs to produce insulin. When fasting, eating carbs was the only method I found to bring the levels back down, but it came at a price. I would not recommend working out or fasting, as both activities will cause an increase in ketone production.



## About

I am an average mid-30's healthy guy who gained ~50 lbs over '20/'21. I was looking to lose weight without starving, eating veggies solely, or working out. I like some veggies and some working out, but I would rather not if I could help it. 

### Why Keto?
I chose this because it had the most food groups that I could tolerate eating over an extended time.

### My Goal
I wanted to lose 50 lbs passively via dietary modification. Unfortunately, I made several mistakes which pushed me back several weeks from my goal. I think all things optimal, I could have lost the weight in 60 days, but I am now around the 90-day mark with 4.6 lbs left of my 50 lb goal and ready to start sharing the data. 

If that describes what you're looking for, this guide may help determine if a (dirty) keto diet is the right fit for you. If it is the right fit, I hope you can learn from my mistakes and start on the right foot, getting your gains early and often.

### Retro/Lessons Learned
- Scrutinize labels of your food, all of them, know what you are putting in your body
- Be more proactive about adding foods/recipes into tracking app(s) early; you will slip less
- Measure on the scale less, in the beginning. Use exponential back off when things are not going right (more on this later)

### Reading labels

## How to nutrition

### Calculating Net Carbs


#### Dietary Fibers

#### Sugar Substitues


### Sugar Substitutes

#### Monk Fruit
Lo han guo, or Monk Fruit, is a small green melon native to southern China. The sweetener is made from the extract derived from the dried fruit. Monk Fruit is 100+ times sweeter than table sugar, has zero calories, carbs, and does not raise blood glucose levels.

There are no claimed gastrointestinal side effects, unlike Sugar Alcohols. There's no long-term research but is thought to be generally safe to consume over alternatives.

Because it's difficult to grow, harvest, and process, it is expensive. It does have an aftertaste that is unpleasant to some, though in my opinion, less noticeable over sugar alcohols.

>Fruit Allergy Warning: Monk Fruit is in the Curcurbitaceae (melon/gourd) family. If you're allergic to cucumbers/gourds/melons, you will want to avoid Monk Fruit.

#### Sugar Alcohols
Sugar Alcohols, or polyols, are carbohydrates. They are hybrids of the sugar and alcohol molecules, hence the name. SA's are much sweeter than sugar, but they are lower in calories and do not have the adverse effects that sugar does (though they do have their negative effects...). 

Because the structure mimics sugar, it activates the sweet receptors on your tongue. All the SA's, in my experience, have weird after tastes. Erythritol has the least weird tasting, in my opinion.

##### WARNING, Hot Poops
//TODO

If you've not heard of the gastrointestinal consequences of consuming too much Sugar Alcohol, be advised and [read these reviews](https://www.amazon.com/Haribo-Gummi-Candy-Goldbears-Pound/dp/B000EVOSE4/ref=asc_df_B000EVOSE4/). I am able to handle about 10-15 grams per day, but that upper limit guarantees that all farts cannot be trusted the next day. 

When you are new to Keto, be careful of how many sugar alcohols you consume each day. The bloating/cramps are not worth eating the weird-tasting cookie.

| Sugar Alcohol | Carbs/Serving | Do you count it?
|----------------|---------------|-----------------|
 |  erythritol | 4G | No, subtract from total carbs   |
 |  xylitol | 4G | No, subtract from total carbs |
 |  maltitol
 |  isomalt
 |  lactitol
 |  mannitol
 |  sorbitol
 |  hydrogenated starch hydrolysates

Why do you not count carbs from some sugar alcohols? They don't raise your blood sugar.

## Troubleshooting

### Ketones are too low
Use an exogenous BHB supplement. This will make ketones available in the blood. However, do not exceed the dosage as high ketone levels can cause ketoacidosis. 

### Ketones are too high
1. Reintroduce carbs 
	1. Eat some carbs & monitor/test to bring levels within the nominal range
2. Avoid exercise 
	1. When exercising, the liver will metabolize fat and produce more ketones
3. Avoid fasting
	1. Use portion control instead of fasting to help keep ketones in the right range.
	1. Try eating three regular meals and 1-2 snacks
4. Avoid alcohol
	1. Alcohol raises ketone levels because it causes the pancreas to stop producing insulin for some time.


According to my app, high ketones started for me at the 50th consecutive day of staying under 25g of carbs. I started feeling off for a few days during a holiday week where I was not moving around and was not as hungry/eating as much. When I sampled my blood, I was 3.2 mmol/L 3 hours after a meal with 16g of carbs, which is pretty high for where I usually sit (between .8-2.2 first thing in the morning). I felt weak/tired, and lethargic. I ate two pop-tarts and Great Value Oatmeal Cookies at 10a; when I sampled again at 1:30, I was 1.8 mmol/L. Later that evening, sampled again at 5p, I was back up at 2.8. Again, I ate some carbs for dinner and went to bed. Stopping the fast and eating meals was the end solution.



### No weightloss/stalled weightloss
3 months is the "clinical" amount of time before considering yourself stalled. If you do not have gains, the very first thing should be scrutinizing what you're putting in your body. Do not assume. If you've been using an app, you need to double check all the details. You're likely missing something.

If you've checked and checked, use the "exponential backoff" technique to help take your mind off. This works by only allowing yourself to measure at doubled intervals. For example, you weigh day 1, if unfavorable, you skip the next day and weigh again. If unfavorable, you skip 2 days, then 4, then 8, then 16 until you see the results. Alternately, you can weigh weekly. The goal here is not to focus on day-to-day, your loss will be better visualized week to week or month to month.

Reminder about weighing, you must weigh under the exact conditions every time. Ideally, after you wake up and have no fluids in your body. If you weigh at different times of the day or in different attire, your readings will not be reflective.


# Awareness

## Don't reward yourself with carbs
As soon as you exit the diet, you will gain weight by forming a habit of rewarding yourself with sugar. It's an easy trap to fall into. Just be mindful of training yourself with bad habits.

## Remove nutrition from food
Take vitamins and supplements to augment what you're missing from food. It's hard(er) to incorporate caloric intake and nutrition. If you're struggling to eat healthy, augment the healthy and eat dark chocolate and chicken for dinner :)
