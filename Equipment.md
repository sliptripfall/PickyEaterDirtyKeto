## Blenders (for shakes/meal replacements)
The Ninja was an upgrade from the magic bullet. The only complaint I have is when blending almond milk, whey & fat powders. The mixture is so whipped that there is a ton of froth. If you immediately pour, you will be disappointed - let it sit for 5-10 minutes, and the froth dies down. From there, this is the smoothest and best experience I've had with powdered meal replacements.

I started with the magic bullet, but it does not do a good job at getting the fine whey/protein and fat powders. If you don't put the (almond) milk & ice in first, it will cake to the top of the bullet and won't blend. If you're making a very small quantity, it's great, but if you're trying to make a 40oz meal replacement - it's a complete pain in the ass. Even with extra cups, blender attachments, etc. it's more effort. That said, they can double as cups, so I use them for BHB supplement powders and other powdered drinks.

## Chocolate Melting

This was cheaper than the professional chocolatier's equipment, but I think it would be challenging to temper the chocolate in this. I found that, full of water, level 2 on the dial is ~100 degrees. Most of the time, I fill the fondue pot with water and put it on 8-10. I  use a metal bowl above to heat the ingredients and pull away from the heat, being as careful as you don't want moisture in the chocolate.

## Molds

These are the perfect size for chocolate peanutbutter cups, you can layer them too - but crunch peanutbutter is a hard fit.

This is my go to, they're big enough to fit almonds and crunch peanutbutter

# Testing

## Blood
This is the most important piece of equipment you should buy. Monitoring your ketone levels in your blood will give you the information you need to correct any ill feelings due to too low or too high ketones in the blood.


### About painful pricks
Using a lancet pen SHOULD NOT HURT. If you have a throb or deep pain, either your head is adjusted to puncture too far into the skin or you're pressing the head against your skin too hard. Try easeing up on the pressure or depth, you will feel a pinch but it shouldn't "hurt".

I use the sides of my ring and pinky fingers due to calluses.

## Breath

This thing is not that great, but when you measure it with your blood readings and log both, you can map out where you are and lean on it a little more to save money on the lancets and test strips.
