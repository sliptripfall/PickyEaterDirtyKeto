When buying chocolate, it can be confusing what form you should buy it in and whether or not it will have sugar already added. Here's some information about chocolate to get the terminology and what I usually buy.

(unroasted) Cacao Bean:
 	- Cacao Nib: The beans can be broken down into nibs (they look like chocolate chips but have the same nutrition as the whole bean)
		 - Cacao Paste: made from cacao nibs that were slowly heated
		 - Cacao Butter: the outer lining of a bean has a white, rich, fatty texture
		 - Cacao Powder: Made from cold-pressed, unroasted cocoa beans, cocoa powder is made by removing the fat but leaving the live enzymes intact. 

(roasted) Cocoa Bean:
	- Powder
		- Cocoa Powder: The dry solid remains of the roasted bean once the butter is removed. Has slightly lower nutritional value due to high heat in processing.
		- Cocoa Powder Mix: cocoa powder + sugar and fats (usually found in grocery stores)
	- Chocolate
		- Chocolate Liquor: Pure Cocoa in a solid or semisolid form containing cocoa solids and cocoa butter. Chocolate liquor is the same thing as unsweetened chocolate.
		- Dark Chocolate (bittersweet, semisweet): Chocolate liquor + Cocoa butter and sugar.
		- Milk Chocolate: Chocolate liquor plus milk powder or condensed milk
		- White Chocolate: No cocoa solids; just cocoa butter, sugar, and milk.

Cacao - made from beans that have not been roasted (more bitter, more nutritious)
Cocoa - made from beans that are both fermented and roasted (less bitter, slightly darker)
Chocolate Liquor -

Note: Cacao powder is higher in calories and fiber than Cocoa because the nutrients and fats are still present. Cacao powder is a good source of monosaturated fats, or "good fats" - you will often see this marketed in keto products an MCT (medium-chain triglyceride) oil. A tablespoon of MCT oil contains ~14 grams of fat and 115 calories.

Note: Cocoa can contain dairy and sugar, though Cacao should never have those ingredients.

Note#2: If you're cooking with the chocolate, this is not Dutched Processed (aka alkalized Cocoa) and does not react with baking soda. Alkalized cocoa makes it darker in color, less bitter, and dissolves easily into liquids. (Oreo cookies are made from dutched Cocoa)

# Snacks

I use Peanut butter mainly for the fat bombs. I do not eat it from the jar, though you could. Just be aware that there's 3 carbs per 2 Tbsp, so you can't have much. In my opinion, it is too many grams to get a satisfying amount of peanut butter - best left as an ingredient.

This is a no-brainer; the only danger here is that it's easy to blow past your protein and not intake enough fat. You can augment that by making fat bombs //TODO insert xref to fatbomb
