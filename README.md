# Picky Eaters Guide to Dirty Keto

Hi, I am an average mid-30's healthy guy who gained ~40 lbs over '20/'21. Already being 10 lbs heavier than I wanted to start, I was looking to lose 50 lbs without eating primarily vegetables or working out. I like some veggies, and I like some working out, but I would rather not if I could help it. Dirty Keto was the perfect fit to lose weight.

If that also describes you, this guide may help determine if a Keto diet is the right fit for you. If it is the right fit, I hope you can learn from my mistakes, discoveries and start off on the right foot, getting your gains early and often.

I chose markdown/GitHub because I think this will evolve and change over time, and I want to track that.

### Sugar Substitutes

#### Monk Fruit
Lo han guo, or Monk Fruit, is a small green melon native to souther China. The sweetener is made from extract derived from the dried fruit. The extract is 100+ times sweeter than table sugar, has zero calories, carbs, and does not raise blood glucose levels.

There are no claimed gastrointestinal side effects, unlike Sugar Alcohols. There's no long term research, but is thought to be generally safe to consume over alternatives.

Because it's difficult to grow, harvest, and process it is expensive and it does have an aftertaste which is unplesant to some, though in my opinion less than aspartame.

Fruit Allergy Warning: Monk Fruit is in the Curcurbitaceae (melon/gourd) family, if you're allergic to cucumbers/gourds/melons, you will want to avoid Monk Fruit.

#### Sugar Alcohols
Sugar Alcohols, or polyols, are carbohydrates. They are hybrids of the sugar and alcohol molecules, hence the name. SA's are much sweeter than sugar, but they are lower in calories and do not have the adverse effects that sugar does (though they do have their adverse effects...). 

Because the structure mimics sugar, it activates the sweet receptors on your tongue. All the SA's, in my experience, have weird after tastes. Erythritol has the least weird tasting, in my opinion.

##### WARNING, Hot Poops
If you've not heard of the gastrointestinal consequences of consuming too much Sugar Alcohol, be advised and [read these reviews](https://www.amazon.com/Haribo-Gummi-Candy-Goldbears-Pound/dp/B000EVOSE4/ref=asc_df_B000EVOSE4/). I am able to handle about 10-15 grams per day, but that upper limit guarantees that all farts cannot be trusted the next day. 

When you are new to Keto, be careful of how many sugar alcohols you consume each day. The bloating/cramps are not worth eating the weird-tasting cookie.


| Sugar Alcohol | Carbs/Serving |
|---------------|---------------|
 |  erythritol | 
 |  xylitol
 |  maltitol
 |  isomalt
 |  lactitol
 |  mannitol
 |  sorbitol
 |  hydrogenated starch hydrolysates

## Troubleshooting

### Ketones are too low


### Ketones are too high
1. Reintroduce carbs 
	1. Eat some carbs & monitor/test to bring levels within the nominal range
2. Avoid exercise 
	1. When exercising, the liver will metabolize fat and produce more ketones
3. Avoid fasting
	1. Use portion control instead of fasting to help keep ketones in the right range.
	1. Try eating three regular meals and 1-2 snacks
4. Avoid alcohol
	1. Alcohol raises ketone levels because it causes the pancreas to stop producing insulin for some time.


High ketones started for me at the 50th consecutive day of staying under 25g of carbs, per my app. I started feeling off for a few days during a holiday week where I was not moving around and was not as hungry/eating as much. When I sampled my blood, I was 3.2 mmol/L 3 hours after a meal with 16g of carbs, which is pretty high for where I usually sit (between .8-2.2 first thing in the morning). I felt weak/tired, and lethargic. I ate two pop-tarts and Great Value Oatmeal Cookies at 10a; when I sampled again at 1:30, I was 1.8 mmol/L. Later that evening, sampled again at 5p, I was back up at 2.8. Again, I ate some carbs for dinner and went to bed.
